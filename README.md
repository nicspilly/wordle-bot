Bot for playing wordle!

A random 5 letter word is generated and players have 6 tries to guess it

[Based off the New York Times Wordle Game](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html)

Inital design is a command line game you can play one time

Future ideas include deploying a server in kubernetes, and this server generates 1 random word a day. You can interact with the server at any time to play wordle!
